# Project Overview:
* Hackers Pouletteâ„¢ specializes in selling DIY kits and accessories for Raspberry Pi. They need a solution for users to reach their technical support team.

- Server-side Processing: Perform sanitization and validation on the server side.
- Success Response: Upon successful sanitization and validation, display a "Thank you for contacting us" page that summarizes the submitted information.
- Spam Prevention: Implement a honeypot technique to prevent spam.
# Form Fields:
* Mandatory Fields: First Name, Last Name, Email, Country (dropdown list), Message, Gender (radio buttons for M/F).
